Create new directory called exp.
Clone soca-science into exp directory.
Edit start_year, start month, and start day in prep.ufs_fv3_cpld.sh.
Copy exp.config from /work/noaa/marine/Cameron.Book/fv3/ng-godas/cpld_setup into exp directory. 
Run prep.ufs_fv3_cpld.sh by entering 'sh prep.ufs_fv3_cpld.sh' in the command line.
(This will run 12h ufs-weather model RT cpld_bmark_v16 to generate restart files needed by soca-science,
and stage all necessary configuration files and UFS scripts, as well as set the EXP_START_DATE and BKGRST directory in exp.config.)
Link cycle.sh from $exp/soca-science/scripts/workflow/cycle.sh to exp. directory.
Source proper modules (if on Orion, do source $exp/soca-science/configs/machine/machine.orion.intel).
Submit soca-science experiment with ./cycle.sh.
